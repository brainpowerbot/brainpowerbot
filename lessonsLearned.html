      <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Research versus traditional project</h1>
          <p>
            One of the biggest challenges we had to overcome was the fact that this is a research project and not a traditional project
            like typical school assignments.
            None of us have done research in an academic environment before so we had to take time to get used to conducting research, 
            how we kept track of progress being made or not, and balancing the amount of time researching versus actually getting something
            coded. When doing research it is hard to tell what progress is being made when everyone is either still reading or gathering
            resources to back up their claims. Not only that, but knowing where to begin looking for sources or data sets was difficult.
            Figuring out the amount of time we should take to do research on something was difficult. We were not sure if we were
            spending the right amount of time on something or spending too much time. After a while the team found a good amount of time
            to spend on research to get progress done on the code as well.

  <div class="w3-row w3-padding-64" id="PlatformRestriction">
      <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Social media platform restriction</h1>
          <p>
            The social media platform we wanted to use was Facebook. Facebook has the most information and connections that we can then
            use to make our bot as helpful to our target audience as possible. Any other social media site did not have the depth
            of information we were hoping to gain access to. The only issue, however, is that Facebook does have the data but we could
            not access that data. Reading through the documents of what was possible with the Facebook API made us believe that we could
            indeed access all the data we wanted. However, there was a section of the documents we neglected to read carefully that mentioned
            access to this data was deprecated after a version update of the API. Since we were doing a ton of research at the same time,
            it is difficult to get every single detail of what we were looking into. This API update removed access to most of the data that
            was previously accessible and gave us a big roadblock to overcome to finish this project. We overcame this by creating a test environment
            within Facebook that still gave us access to the information of these "test users" for our bot. Only in this test environment is this
            possible, but it works wonders for a proof of concept.

      <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Conducting research</h1>
          <p>
            Conducting research is harder than it may seem. While most of our team was used to just doing an assignment that was
            given to them, this project was not that. Research implies that you give guidance for the project to yourself. Depending
            on what you find out while reading or looking at data sets, you decide where to go next. Not only that but managing
            time researching versus making progress to your project is a challenge. Most of us also learned pretty quickly that finding
            good data sets or articles to read is also difficult. You have to keep in mind the time this data was published and how
            relevant it is now. You have to make sure that you are not wasting time reading something that is not getting at what you want.
            At the end of it all we all learned a ton throughout this project and without conducting research, that would not
            have been possible.

  <div class="w3-row w3-padding-64" id="FlexibleProject">
      <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Being flexible with project management</h1>
          <p>
              We realized very quickly that in a research project the only guidance that is given, in terms of a path for work 
              on the project, is given mainly by the team itself. That was a challenge for us since, again, everyone on our team was 
              used to having someone else say what to do. Most of us were accustomed to how we were taught industry works. Most tech companies
              do things the same way. The project management style they use is called Agile. You get a task to do and have frequent checks with
              somebody to make sure you are on the right track. With this project, however, that was not going to work. Mainly because our tasks
              were not specified at all. Our tasks were more like "figure out what framework we can use". That is as ambigious as it can get.
              With this being a research based project we needed to make sure we were still making progress and not  wasting  time, 
              so we abandoned Agile. This took some time to get used to but once we got into the right amount of time to take researching
              a topic, development went smoothly.

  <div class="w3-row w3-padding-64" id="Important">
      <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Deciding what is important and what is not</h1>
          <p>
            As mentioned before, deciding when it was time to put research to the side and get some development done was crucial.
            Just as crucial, though, was knowing what was important enough to make sure all the right research was done before development
            starts. The choice of our bot framework, for example, was important to take our time on conducting research for. 
            If we chose the wrong framework and a lot of development time was already put into it and we find out that the framework 
            will no longer work for us, that is a lot of time wasted. To keep that from happening we made sure that decisions like that
            were made with complete certainty. We also had to learn when to make quick decisions where the topics were not necessarily 
            too important. Throughout the semester we realized that we were making decisions a lot faster than when we first started out
            with the project.

            What went well in general throughout this project was the following:

          <ul>
            <li>Frequent team meetings to keep track of progress being made</li>
            <li>Everyone on the team was held accountable and everyone got their tasks done</li>

            What could have been improved upon are the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal deadlines kept getting pushed back</li>
            <li>The class as a whole was put lower in people's priorities throughout the year</li>
            <li>Having a noisy meeting place was distracting</li>
